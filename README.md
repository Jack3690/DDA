# Data Driven Astronomy

This GitHub page contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with various routines for astronomical data acquisition, visualization, and analysis.

The notebooks can be followed as a four-week course where each week explores a particular type of data (image, table, IFU, etc.).
Each notebook also contains a puzzle at the end which can be used to test your understanding of the code.

# Acknowledgement

These notebooks were created and used for the online course called Data Driven Astronomy organized by the Positron Foundation which helped in testing and making the notebooks more readable.
